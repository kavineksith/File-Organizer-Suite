# üóÇÔ∏è File Organizer (Item Organizer)

A high-performance, parallelized file organizer designed for efficient sorting of large collections of files into categorized directories.

* Organizes files into predefined or custom categories (e.g., images, documents, scripts, etc.)
* Uses checksum (MD5) to detect and handle duplicate files
* Supports parallel processing using `ThreadPoolExecutor`
* Generates detailed operation reports and logs
* Automatically creates destination subdirectories
* Configurable conflict resolution strategies (`rename`, `overwrite`, `skip`)
* Supports custom category mappings via JSON configuration
